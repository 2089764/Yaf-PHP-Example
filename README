Yaf-php Example Project

http://uk.php.net/manual/en/book.yaf.php

This is a full-ish example Yaf application implementing:
- Zend-like folder structure
- Error Controller
- Third Party libraries (zend_db)*
- Routing

Requirements:
- PHP 5.3+
- Yaf Extension Installed/Enabled
- PDO (sqlite)
- .htaccess must be enabled

Useful:
- Sqliteman (Linux)
- Sqlite Administrator (Windows)

Example Development Apache Vhost:

    #ensure vhosts are enabled
    NameVirtualHost *:80

    #the vhost
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot [project dir]/public
        ServerName yaf.dev #or whatever
    </VirtualHost>

Set the environment in you php.ini by adding this to the bottom:

    [yaf]
    yaf.environ=devel

Set you hosts file to:

    127.0.0.1   yaf.dev #or whatever

*Note on included zend component:
To get this to work just did a find-replace for "require_once" and replace it with "//require_once".
Loading will all work though the autoloader but not as a require as the lib is not in the
include path.
